# Polynomials

Several implementations of polynomials to illustrate various programming styles.

## What is it?

1. `polynomials-1.0.py`: polynomial functions are created using higher-order
   functions.
2. `polynomials-2.0.py`: polynomial functions are represented as objects of
   a class that implements the `__call__` function. 
2. `polynomials-3.0.py`: polynomial functions are represented as objects of
   a class that implements the `__call__` function.  The implementation uses
   functional features.
